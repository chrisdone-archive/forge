## Ideas

* Use applicative regex + pattern= to enable additional client-side
  checks:

* Autocomplete? IDEA: rather than specifying field names in the form
  itself, do a transform of the keys later? Custom names are
  inherently non-compositional, but a rewrite for the purposes of
  browser completion ain't bad. Or something else, as a separate pass,
  with hints.
* Step, min/max, etc:

* Autofocus?
* Autocomplete attr?
* Disabled?
